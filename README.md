# Driving-Vehicle-Licenses-Department
The DVLD system is a C# (WinForms) and SQL Server desktop application designed to digitize driver and vehicle licensing operations. It follows a 3-tier architecture (Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access) and supports full CRUD operations for managing people, licenses, and vehicles.

---

## Architecture

The project follows the **3-Tier Architecture**:

1. **Presentation Layer (UI):**
   - Built with Windows Forms.
   - Handles all user interactions, such as buttons, forms, validation on the UI tier and DataGridViews.

2. **Business Logic Layer (BLL):**
   - Contains the core application logic and rules.
   - Validates data and ensures system consistency.
   - Acts as a bridge between the UI and the Data Access Layer.

3. **Data Access Layer (DAL):**
   - Uses ADO.NET to interact with SQL Server.
   - Responsible for all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Main Features

### Main Page (Dashboard)

The main page serves as the systemâ€™s control panel, allowing users to quickly access all modules such as **Applications**, **People**, **Users**, **Drivers**, and **Licenses**.  
From here, administrators can open any section to perform management tasks efficiently.

### Manage People List and Filtering

The **Manage People** section provides a centralized dashboard displaying all registered individuals with options to **search**, **filter**, **update**, and **delete** records.  
Users can dynamically filter and search for people based on various fields such as **Name**, **National Number**, or other attributes, allowing for quick and efficient data access.
